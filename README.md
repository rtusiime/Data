# Web Development Project 5 - WeatherDashboard

Submitted by: **Kevin Tusiime**

This web app, WeatherDash, is a dynamic and interactive dashboard application designed to display weather information based on user search queries. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for different locations and renders this information on weather cards. The app includes a search functionality that allows users to filter locations based on the prefix entered in the search bar.

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

## Notes

Building this application presented several challenges, particularly in handling asynchronous API calls and ensuring the UI updates promptly and correctly based on the fetched data. Implementing the search functionality to filter through the weather data dynamically also required careful state management. Another significant challenge was designing a responsive UI that provides an excellent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
